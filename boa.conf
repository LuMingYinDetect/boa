# Boa v0.94 configuration file
# File format has changed little from 0.92
# version changes are noted in the comments
#
# The Boa configuration file is parsed with a lex/yacc or flex/bison
# generated parser.  If it reports an error, the line number will be
# provided; it should be easy to spot.  The syntax of each of these
# rules is very simple, and they can occur in any order.  Where possible
# these directives mimic those of NCSA httpd 1.3; I saw no reason to 
# introduce gratuitous differences.

# The "ServerRoot" is not in this configuration file.  It can be compiled
# into the server (see defines.h) or specified on the command line with
# the -c option, for example:
#
# boa -c /usr/local/boa


# Port: The port Boa runs on.  The default port for http servers is 80.
# If it is less than 1024, the server must be started as root.

Port 80

#  User: The name or UID the server should run as.
# Group: The group name or GID the server should run as.

User nobody
Group nogroup

# ServerAdmin: The email address where server problems should be sent.
# Note: this is not currently used.

ServerAdmin root@localhost

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file. If this does not start
# with /, it is considered relative to the server root.
# Set to /dev/null if you don't want errors logged.

ErrorLog /var/log/boa/error_log

# AccessLog: The location of the access log file. If this does not
# start with /, it is considered relative to the server root.
# Comment out or set to /dev/null (less effective) to disable 
# Access logging.

AccessLog /var/log/boa/access_log

# VerboseCGILogs: this is just a logical switch.
# Comment out to disable.

#VerboseCGILogs

# ServerName: the name of this server that should be sent back to 
# clients if different than that returned by gethostname -- often
# this is www.foo.bar.

#ServerName www.your.org.here

# VirtualHost: a logical switch.
# Comment out to disable.
# Given DocumentRoot /var/www, requests on interface 'A' or IP 'IP-A'
# become /var/www/IP-A.
# Example: http://localhost/ becomes /var/www/127.0.0.1

#VirtualHost 

# DocumentRoot: The root directory of the HTML documents.

DocumentRoot /var/www

# UserDir: The name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home
# directory if a ~user request is recieved.

UserDir public_html

# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Please MAKE AND USE THESE FILES.  On the
# fly creation of directory indexes can be _slow_.
# 

DirectoryIndex index.html

DirectoryMaker /usr/lib/cgi-bin/boa_indexer

# KeepAliveMax: Number of KeepAlive requests to allow per connection
# Comment out, or set to 0 to disable keepalive processing

KeepAliveMax 100

# KeepAliveTimeout: seconds to wait before keepalive connection times out

KeepAliveTimeout 10

# MimeTypes: This is the file that is used to generate mime type pairs
# and Content-Type fields for boa.

MimeTypes /etc/mime.types

# DefaultType: MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there
# is no file extension.

DefaultType text/plain

# AddType: adds types without editing mime.types
# Example: AddType type extension [extension ...]

# Uncomment the next line if you want .cgi files to execute from anywhere
#AddType application/x-httpd-cgi cgi

# Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -- they
# match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action.  Use
# Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and ScriptAlias
# to enable directories for script execution.

# Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in
# your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you to tell the
# clients where to look for the relocated document.
# Example: Redirect /bar http://elsewhere/feh/bar

# Aliases: Aliases one path to another.
# Example: Alias /path1/bar /path2/foo

Alias /doc /usr/doc

# ScriptAlias: Maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts
# Example: ScriptAlias /htbin/ /www/htbin/

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
