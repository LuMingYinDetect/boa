boa (0.92-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Misspelling: cgi-directory created was named /usr/lib/cgi-lib instead of
    /usr/lib/cgi-bin. conf file already listed it as /usr/lib/cgi-bin
  * Transparently process .gz files without the need for changing any
    filenames (patch by the author). I.e. a reference to index.html will
    fetch and decompress index.html.gz if index.html is not present.

boa (0.92-2) unstable; urgency=low
